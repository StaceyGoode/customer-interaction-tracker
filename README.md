The Customer Interaction Tracker is a portfolio project that demonstrates my ability to maintain organized, accurate records of customer interactions in a CRM-style system.
It showcases meticulous documentation practices, automated data validation, and the generation of clear, actionable reports — skills essential for customer success, operations, or AI data-support roles.

This project automatically:

Tracks customer communications (date, method, notes, agent)

Logs follow-up dates and status updates

Validates and cleans data for consistency

Generates structured reports for summaries and follow-ups

I created this to simulate how real-world teams maintain detailed, reliable communication records.
It reflects strong attention to detail, data organization, and documentation discipline — the same skills I use to manage information efficiently and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
